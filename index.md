# Useful In Theory

## Prologue

My intention with this blog is to explore computer science theory from the perspective of a professional programmer.  I'll be using the term _theory_ loosely to encompass almost anything that's published in a journal, but i don't feel too bad about that since even the theorists [can't quite agree](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2015/8/189832-why-doesnt-acm-have-a-sig-for-theoretical-computer-science/fulltext) on what theory is.

My sense is that there is more interest in CS theory among software engineers now than there has been in prior decades. [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F04mg4%2C%20%2Fm%2F01txp%2C%20%2Fm%2F0f15vd%2C%20%2Fm%2F01r_h&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B8) does not back me up on that, but I would cite the increasing popularity of things like [PapersWeLove](http://paperswelove.org/), blogs like Adrian Colyer's [The Morning Paper](http://blog.acolyer.org/) and Jeremy Kun's [Math &cap; Programming](http://jeremykun.com/), and the burgeoning interest in functional programming.  This wouldn't be surprising given the explosion of work on algorithms and distributed systems in big data and cloud computing.

I also think the study of theory is a good counterbalance to the software-as-craftmanship movement, which (unintentionally I think) encourages the idea that programming != computer science.  On the contrary I think even the most mundane CRUD app is benefiting from an enormous amount of computer science-- we just don't usually have to think about it anymore.

Anway, here we go.  Not surprisingly, the first topic is a [variation of hashing](http://mikemull.github.io/lsh.html).
